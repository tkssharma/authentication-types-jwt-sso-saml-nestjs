## 🔑 2. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Essentials

---

### 📦 What is JWT?

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a **compact**, **URL-safe**, and **digitally signed** token format used to securely transmit information between parties.

- It is **stateless** — the token contains all the data needed to verify identity.
- Commonly used in **token-based authentication** and **authorization**.

### 🧬 JWT Structure

A JWT has **three parts**, separated by dots:

```bash
xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
|     |     |
|     |     └── Signature (verifies authenticity)
|     └── Payload (claims/data)
└── Header (algorithm & token type)
```

#### 1. **Header**

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

#### 2. **Payload**

Contains **claims** – pieces of information (user ID, roles, expiration):

```json
{
  "sub": "user_123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": 1722105600
}
```

#### 3. **Signature**

A hashed value (e.g., HMAC SHA256) of the header and payload, signed with a secret key.

```bash
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
)
```

### 🔁 Access Tokens vs Refresh Tokens

| Token Type        | Purpose                    | Storage              | Expiry                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Access Token**  | Authenticates API requests | Memory / Header      | Short-lived (15m–1h)   |
| **Refresh Token** | Issues new access tokens   | HttpOnly Cookie / DB | Long-lived (7–30 days) |

- Access tokens are used frequently and should be short-lived for security.
- Refresh tokens are used sparingly to obtain new access tokens, often stored securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookie or DB).

### ⏳ JWT Expiration Strategies

#### ✅ Common Claims

- `exp` – Expiration time (Unix timestamp)
- `iat` – Issued at
- `nbf` – Not before (optional)

#### 🔄 Expiry Patterns:

1. **Short access token + long refresh token** (recommended)
2. **No refresh token — force re-login on expiration**
3. **Rolling refresh** – refresh token expiry extends after each use

> 💡 Pro tip: Never trust an expired JWT. Always validate the `exp` claim.

### ⚠️ Risks and Best Practices

| Risk                       | Mitigation                                               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ Token theft (e.g., XSS) | ✅ Store token in HttpOnly cookie, not localStorage      |
| ❌ Token replay            | ✅ Use short expiries and rotate refresh tokens          |
| ❌ No server revocation    | ✅ Use a blacklist or token version field in DB          |
| ❌ Overstuffed payload     | ✅ Keep payload minimal (no sensitive data)              |
| ❌ Algorithm confusion     | ✅ Always specify strong algorithms (e.g., HS256, RS256) |

---

### ✅ Summary

- JWTs are self-contained and secure **if used properly**.
- Split concerns: **access token for auth**, **refresh token for renewal**.
- Watch out for **XSS**, **replay attacks**, and **overexposed payloads**.
