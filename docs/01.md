## **1. Understanding Authentication & Authorization**

### **1.1 Definition of Authentication**

- **What is Authentication?**
    - Process of verifying a userâ€™s identity before granting access to a system.
    - Ensures that the user is who they claim to be.
- **How Authentication Works**
    - User provides credentials (username/password, biometrics, etc.).
    - System verifies credentials against a database or identity provider.
    - If valid, the user is authenticated and granted access.
- **Types of Authentication**
    - **Single-Factor Authentication (SFA)** â€“ Password-based login.
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** â€“ Combination of two or more factors (password + OTP, biometric, security key).
    - **Passwordless Authentication** â€“ Login via email link, magic link, or biometrics.
- **Common Authentication Mechanisms**
    - **Basic Authentication** â€“ Username and password sent in request headers.
    - **Token-Based Authentication** â€“ Uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or other token-based systems.
    - **Biometric Authentication** â€“ Fingerprints, facial recognition, retina scan, etc.
    - **SSO (Single Sign-On)** â€“ One login for multiple services (Google, Facebook login).

### **1.2 Definition of Authorization**

- **What is Authorization?**
    - Determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do.
    - Defines user permissions, roles, and access levels.
- **How Authorization Works**
    - After authentication, the system checks user roles/permissions.
    - Based on access rules, the system allows or denies actions.
- **Types of Authorization**
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** â€“ Access based on predefined roles (Admin, Editor, User).
    - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** â€“ Access based on attributes like location, device, or clearance level.
    - **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** â€“ Users control access to resources they own.
    - **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** â€“ System-enforced policies define access permissions.

### **1.3 Key Differences Between Authentication & Authorization**

| Feature | Authentication | Authorization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Verifies user identity | Determines user permissions |
| **When it Happens** | Before authorization | After authentication |
| **Example** | Logging in with username & password | Accessing admin dashboard vs. user dashboard |
| **Data Used** | Credentials (password, biometrics) | Roles, policies, permissions |

### **1.4 Common Authentication & Authorization Flows**

### **1.4.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- Assigns permissions based on user roles (e.g., Admin, User, Guest).
- Common in enterprise applications, CMS, and SaaS platforms.
- Example:
    - **Admin** â†’ Full access (create, read, update, delete).
    - **Editor** â†’ Can create and edit content but cannot delete.
    - **Viewer** â†’ Read-only access.
- **Implementation** in NestJS:
    - Using **Guards** and **Decorators** to restrict access to endpoints.

### **1.4.2 Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**

- Access is granted based on **user attributes** (e.g., location, department, clearance level).
- More dynamic and flexible than RBAC.
- Example:
    - A **remote employee** can access internal systems only from a VPN.
    - A **user from a certain country** is restricted from certain actions due to regulations.
- **Implementation** in NestJS:
    - Using policies and custom **authorization logic** to check attributes.

### **1.4.3 OAuth2 & OpenID Connect**

- **OAuth2** (Open Authorization) â€“ Standard for **delegated access**.
    - Allows third-party apps to access user data **without exposing credentials**.
    - Example: Logging in to an app using Google or GitHub.
    - Uses **Access Tokens** for authorization.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** â€“ Authentication layer built on top of OAuth2.
    - Provides **identity verification** and user profile information.
    - Uses **ID Tokens** to verify user identity.
- **OAuth2 Grant Types:**
    - **Authorization Code Flow** (Most secure, used in web apps).
    - **Implicit Flow** (Deprecated, used for SPAs).
    - **Client Credentials Flow** (For server-to-server authentication).
    - **Password Grant** (Less secure, used in legacy apps).
- **Implementation** in NestJS:
    - Using **Passport.js** strategies for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
    - Integrating **Google, GitHub, Facebook login** in a NestJS API.
