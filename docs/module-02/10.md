Absolutely! Here's a clear **flow and design** for a **JWT-in-Cookie based login system using NestJS**, designed for web clients (e.g., React, Angular) that rely on cookies for authentication.

---

## üç™ JWT in Cookie Auth ‚Äì System Design (with NestJS)

---

### üéØ **Objective**

Implement secure **login/logout** functionality where:

- JWT is issued on login and stored in an **HttpOnly cookie**
- The server reads and validates the JWT **from the cookie**
- Protected routes are accessible only if the JWT is valid

---

## üîÑ Authentication Flow

### 1. **Login Request**

- **Client** sends POST `/auth/login` with username & password.
- **Server**:

  - Validates user credentials
  - Signs a JWT (e.g., `{ sub: user.id, username: user.username }`)
  - Sends the JWT in a `Set-Cookie` header:

    ```http
    Set-Cookie: auth_token=eyJ...; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax
    ```

> üõ°Ô∏è Cookie is not accessible via `document.cookie` (HttpOnly), and only sent on HTTPS (Secure).

---

### 2. **Client Stores Cookie**

- Browser automatically stores the `auth_token` cookie.
- On future requests to the API, the browser **automatically includes the cookie**.

---

### 3. **Authenticated API Requests**

- For protected routes (e.g., `GET /profile`, `POST /data`), server:

  - Extracts the JWT from `req.cookies.auth_token`
  - Validates JWT signature and expiration
  - Attaches decoded user info to request

---

### 4. **Protected Routes**

- Use a **custom `JwtAuthGuard`** (built using Passport's `JwtStrategy`)

  - This guard reads the cookie, verifies the token, and allows access to the route if valid.

---

### 5. **Logout**

- Client calls `POST /auth/logout`
- Server:

  - Returns a `Set-Cookie: auth_token=; Max-Age=0` to clear the cookie
  - Optionally clears server-side session or token blocklist (if using)

## üîê Security Considerations

| Area                | Design                                                                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token Location**  | Stored in **HttpOnly cookie** (not in localStorage)                        |
| **CSRF Protection** | Use `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict`; add CSRF token for sensitive ops           |
| **XSS Protection**  | HttpOnly cookies are not accessible via JS                                 |
| **Expiration**      | JWTs should have short expiry (`exp` claim), optionally use refresh tokens |
| **Secure Flag**     | Use `Secure` in production to enforce HTTPS-only cookies                   |

## üìÅ Module Breakdown

| Module           | Responsibility                                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `AuthService`    | Validates credentials, signs JWT                      |
| `AuthController` | Handles `/login`, `/logout`, and optional `/refresh`  |
| `JwtStrategy`    | Reads JWT from `req.cookies.auth_token`, validates it |
| `JwtAuthGuard`   | Protects routes via Nest‚Äôs guard system               |
| `UserService`    | Fetches and validates users from DB                   |

---

## üß† Optional Enhancements

- **Refresh token cookie** (HttpOnly + longer-lived) for silent re-authentication
- **CSRF token** in a non-HttpOnly cookie or custom header
- **Token revocation** logic (store blacklisted tokens or use short-lived tokens + refresh)

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Stateless backend: No sessions stored on server
- Secure: JWT in **HttpOnly cookie**, protected by `Secure` + `SameSite`
- Simple: Works natively in browser ‚Äî no need for Authorization headers
- Scalable: Stateless JWTs are easy to scale across servers
