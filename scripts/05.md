Absolutely! Here's a **quick recap** of everything we’ve built and learned across the 4-video series on **NestJS Session-Based Authentication** with Redis, Passport, and TypeORM:

## 🔐 **NestJS Auth Series: Quick Recap**

---

### ✅ **Video 1: Setup + Docker + TypeORM + Redis**

- Bootstrapped a NestJS project with `@nestjs/typeorm`, `@nestjs/config`
- Used **Docker Compose** to run:
  - **PostgreSQL** for the database
  - **Redis** to store sessions
- Integrated `TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync` with `ConfigModule` for **dynamic DB config**
- Created a RedisModule + RedisService for reusability across the app

---

### 🧑‍💻 **Video 2: User Entity + LocalStrategy + Passport Auth Flow**

- Defined a `User` entity using TypeORM
- Built `UsersService` with `findByEmail()` and `findById()`
- Implemented Passport’s **LocalStrategy** to validate username/password
- Created `AuthService` to handle login logic (with bcrypt)
- Used `AuthGuard('local')` to handle login endpoint

---

### 💾 **Video 3: Sessions + Redis + Serialize/Deserialize User**

- Configured `express-session` to use **Redis as the session store**
- Integrated Passport middleware (`initialize` + `session`)
- Implemented `SessionSerializer`:
  - `serializeUser(user)` → saves user ID in session
  - `deserializeUser(id)` → loads user from DB and attaches to `req.user`
- Added `/auth/me` route to return logged-in user
- Confirmed sessions persist across requests

---

### 🔐 **Video 4: Auth Guards, Logout, and Securing Routes**

- Created a custom `AuthenticatedGuard` to protect routes using `req.isAuthenticated()`
- Protected sensitive routes like `/me` and `/logout`
- Implemented `logout()` to destroy session and remove user context
- Added `/auth/status` to check login state
- (Optional) Showed how to register a **global guard** with `APP_GUARD` to protect all routes by default

---

## 📁 Tech Stack Recap

- **NestJS** (Backend framework)
- **Passport.js** (Authentication strategy)
- **Sessions** via `express-session`
- **Redis** (Session store)
- **PostgreSQL** + TypeORM (User data)
- **Docker** (Environment consistency)

---

## 🛠 You Now Have…

✅ A **secure session-based login system**  
✅ Auth that persists across requests without JWTs  
✅ Clean logout, Redis integration, and protected routes  
✅ A modular, extensible codebase ready for production
