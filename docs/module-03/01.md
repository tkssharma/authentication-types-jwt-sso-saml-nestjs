## 📘 1. Introduction to Token-Based Authentication

---

### 🔐 What is Token-Based Authentication?

**Token-based authentication** is a **stateless** method where the server issues a **signed token** to the client after successful login. This token is then sent by the client in each request (usually in the `Authorization` header) to prove their identity.

#### Example:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR...
```

The most common token format is **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.

### ⚖️ Stateful vs Stateless Authentication

| Feature                     | Stateful (e.g. Sessions)                            | Stateless (e.g. Tokens)                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Server stores session data? | ✅ Yes                                              | ❌ No                                       |
| Scaling                     | Harder (needs sticky sessions or centralized store) | Easier (token carries all info)             |
| Request validation          | Server looks up session store                       | Server verifies token signature             |
| Logout                      | Easy (delete session)                               | Harder (requires token blacklist or expiry) |
| Common Use                  | Traditional web apps                                | APIs, SPAs, mobile apps                     |

### 💡 Common Use Cases for Token-Based Auth

- Public REST APIs
- Single Page Applications (React, Angular, Vue)
- Mobile apps (iOS/Android)
- Microservice communication
- Serverless apps (Lambda, Firebase Functions)
- Third-party authentication (via OAuth tokens)

### 🍪 Tokens vs Sessions vs Cookies (Recap & Contrast)

| Feature     | Tokens (JWT)                             | Sessions                  | Cookies                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Storage     | Client-side (e.g., memory, localStorage) | Server-side               | Client-side                  |
| Stateless   | ✅ Yes                                   | ❌ No                     | Depends                      |
| Transport   | Headers (`Authorization`)                | Cookie                    | Cookie or Header             |
| CSRF Safe   | ✅ Yes (if not using cookies)            | ❌ No (unless protected)  | ❌ Needs CSRF protection     |
| Scalability | ✅ Easy to scale                         | ❌ Requires session store | Varies                       |
| Expiry      | Built-in via `exp`                       | Controlled by server      | Controlled by browser/server |
| Best For    | APIs, SPAs, mobile apps                  | Traditional web apps      | Depends on use               |

> 🔍 **Key Point**: Cookies can be used to store tokens, but token-based auth is still considered **stateless** unless the server keeps track of token state (e.g., blacklists).

### 🧠 Summary:

- Token-based auth is **stateless, scalable, and portable**.
- Ideal for **modern apps** needing API-first or decoupled frontends.
- **JWT** is the most popular format for access and refresh tokens.
